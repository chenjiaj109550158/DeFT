## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation.This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing. As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59X
 speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

See [`/DeFT/DeFT_Readme.md`](./DeFT/DeFT_Readme.md) for details of more examples including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning and speculative decoding.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 # chose your own GPUs
# export model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B" # support llama models
export model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B" # support llama models

# export mode="seq" # for Radix Attention if mem is "paged"
export mem="paged" # "paged":paged memory management
```


Example for Speculative Decoding:
```bash
export task="Speculative_Decoding"
export dataset="../dataset/generation/Speculative_Decoding/APPS_tree_size64.json" # select tree size =64 tokens for token candidates
export prompt_len=6000 # set the prompt_len(if > original prompt len, we will pad it)
export maxseq=7000
export tree_idx=0 # only select the first tree
python examples/run_DeFT_llama_paged.py --model $model --max_seq_len $maxseq  --mode $mode --Branch_controller $task --dataset $dataset --mem $mem --tree_idx $tree_idx --prompt_len $prompt_len
```

export dataset="../dataset/generation/Reasoning/$workload.json" # select tree size =128 tokens for token candidates
export tree_idx=0 # only select the first tree
export prompt_len=4000 # pad the prompt to 4000, if you want to adopt original prompt len, don't export it.
export maxseq=7000 # set it to prompt_len+3000(for generated tokens)
python examples/run_DeFT_llama_paged.py --model $model --max_seq_len $maxseq  --mode $mode --Branch_controller $task --dataset $dataset --mem $mem --tree_idx $tree_idx --prompt_len $prompt_len
```

#### **Note on Potential Output Issues**

For certain settings, the output might consist of random or unmeaningful words. Below are two specific scenarios to be aware of:

1. **When setting `--prompt_len` longer than the actual prompt length:**
   - If the provided prompt length is shorter than the value set by `--prompt_len`, the prompt will be padded to meet the specified length. However, the additional content may result in unmeaningful output.
   - **Example**:
     When the task is set to `Simple_Tree`, with `--prompt_len` set to `4000` and `--max_seq_len` set to `4400`, the prompt will be padded to `4000` tokens, and the model will generate exactly `400` tokens. The generated content may lack coherence.

2. **When using `Speculative_Decoding`:**
   - This task is a mocked version designed to verify token handling. Token candidates are selected from the top-k logits, which means the output does not carry meaningful content.

## Results
#### Performance metrics
We list part of the performance metrics as follows. For a full list of metrics, see [PerfMetrics](/DeFT/deft/tree_decoding/perf_metrics.py), which includes iteration latency, memory management latency, time to first token(TTFT), etc. For end-to-end latency, DeFT's still have 15% framework-induced overheads for tree search, branching, etc. We can reduce this by adopting radix cache in [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/), as listed in the [roadmaps](#roadmaps).
- **Decoding latency**: essentially represents the ***optimal end-to-end (e2e) latency***, excluding other overheads such as prefill latency (which accounts for approximately 5-10% of e2e latency) and framework-induced overheads (roughly 10-15% of e2e latency), including tree search, branching, etc. We exclude these overheads because they are consistent across all baselines and to eliminate the influence of the framework.
- **Attention latency**: the latency of attention computation. Note that memory management, such as KV cache management, is not included here; this is mainly decided by paged/unpaged memory management.
- **Time per Output Token(TPOT)**: the average time for token output during the decoding, which is equal to `decoding_latency/#generated_tokens`.

#### Results in the paper
In DeFT paper, the *decoding latency* and *attention latency* are included. Those were tested in earlier version of codes, which means the absolute value might be slightly different but the conclusions is still the same: DeFT-Flatten works the best in all test cases. The setting of prompt length and generation length in DeFT paper can refer to the table as follows.
##### **Table: Prompt length and generation length in DeFT paper**
| Task                  | Prompt Length(tokens) | Generation Length(tokens) |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Few-shot Prompting   | 4000         | 400              |
| Multi-step Reasoning | ~1000        | ~3500            |
| Speculative Decoding | ~1000        | ~5000            |

#### Additional results
We further micro-benchmark DeFT across various sequence lengths in terms of TPOT, decoding latency, and attention latency. **DeFT-Flatten** achieves up to **3×** speedup in TPOT and decoding latency, driven by an impressive **~5×** acceleration in attention latency, as illustrated in the figures below. See more results in `/DeFT/experiments/[task]/[task].ipynb`.
